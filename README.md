# Google Books Search App

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Also, it required me to use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review.

The Google Books Search App has the below 2 pages:

1. A Search page- User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

2) A Saved page- Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
